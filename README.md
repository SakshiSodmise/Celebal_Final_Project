### 📦 Files Included:

- 🧠 `01_Code.ipynb` – Main notebook (original code, untouched)
- 🧾 `02_LOGIC_FOR_PROJECT.pdf` – Stage-wise project logic & flow 
- 🧩 `03_Code-zip-dataset.ipynb` – Same code but with ZIP extract logic  
- 📁 `kddcup.data_10_percent_corrected.zip` – Zipped dataset (for compatibility & upload size limit)

### 💡 Why ZIP?

GitHub limits file uploads to 25MB. The dataset was zipped to reduce size (from 71MB to ~20MB).  
The second notebook extracts it safely **without affecting any logic** ✅
